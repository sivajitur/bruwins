Project Overview: 

We wanted to explore the police arrest rates along with the legalization of drugs across the country. We decided it would be best to make these comparisons by state and see if the police arrest rates and/or marijuana laws affected the rate of drug use in a state.

We think the relevance of these comparisons are incredibly important in order to see how effective the "combative" measures are against drug use.

We took a very systematic approach to our methodology. First, we searched for and compiled all the marijuana legalization law data by state. We then compiled data about the amount of drug related arrests that take place in each state. Finally, we created a neural network which was modeled off of data from 2018, and tested against 2019 data.

This neural network predicted the marijuana legalization level of the respondent's state based on drug use data. It also predicted relative drug arrest rate of respondent's state based on drug use data.


The given data was all survey based, which is a very important factor to consider. Our data included which drugs respondents have taken before, but not whether or not they were habitual users. Since legalization is relatively recent in most states (within the last 10 years), its difficult to fully measure the effects of these policies. It is possible that much of the drug use in states with legal marijuana occurred before legalizationâ€”a scenario that would not be captured in our model. 


Conclusions: The legality of marijuana in a state does not affect drug use in that state. The findings for arrest rates were sparse, so we could not draw any conclusions from it. This is a very important factor to consider in the future however.
